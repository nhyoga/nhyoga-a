These are general classes and therefore suitable for beginners as well as
those with a more established regular practice.

The class is at a slower pace and is structured to take you through a sequence of postures that vary each week. Focus is on the structural alignment of the physical body, putting less stress on the spine and improving posture. The use of blocks, straps, and bricks can help bring more understanding of alignment in the postures, allowing for a deeper way to work, creating the best possible alignment whilst the body opens up. Allowing you to achieve the posture to the best of your ability. The class is physically challenging with plenty of encouragement and hands on adjustments. It is a perfect way to develop your practice whether you are a complete beginner or a more experienced practitioner.

Although yoga is for everyone you do need a certain level of discipline and dedication in order to reap the benefits of your yoga practice. Whether you are looking to alleviate minor ailments, boost confidence, reduce anxiety or just general health and fitness. Practicing yoga on a regular basis has the potential to transform your life.
