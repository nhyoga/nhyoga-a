The class is at a slower pace and is structured to take you through a sequence of postures that vary each week. Focus is on the structural alignment of the physical body, putting less stress on the spine and improving posture. The use of blocks, straps, and bricks can help bring more understanding of alignment. Whether you are looking to alleviate minor ailments, boost confidence, reduce anxiety or just general health and fitness, practicing yoga on a regular basis has the potential to transform your life.
