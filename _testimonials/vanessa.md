I have been practising under Niki’s tuition, attending her yoga classes, since September 2019. I can honestly say that in these months I have thoroughly enjoyed Nik’s method of teaching, she is so precise, so thorough yet so much fun. Each class makes me push myself to better my postures and align my body to how it should be. I have had lower back trouble for three years and with Niki’s teaching I have improved my posture greatly. Even my chiropractor has told me I am more aligned and to keep up the yoga. I cannot praise Niki enough for all she has helped me achieve. To me yoga is much much more than aligning my posture, it is now a way of life. I don’t believe my body would be at its best without a Niki class every week.
