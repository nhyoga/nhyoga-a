I am so pleased to have found Niki as my teacher. 

After a break from yoga classes for a few years, I wanted to return to my Yoga practice, but I had lost confidence, so I asked Niki if I could have a few one-to-one sessions with her. That was three years ago, and I have been seeing Niki regularly ever since. I feel totally supported. Niki sets me challenges and encourages me to meet them. Niki is professional and diligent, and she knows how to bring lightness into the session when appropriate. 

I feel more attuned to my body and stronger, and I know that my yoga journey is a constant work in progress. Niki is amazing and I am blessed to have her as my teacher.
