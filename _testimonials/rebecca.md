Having practised yoga on and off for nearly 30 years, Niki is by far the most knowledgeable and intuitive teacher I have ever had. After attending her group classes for years, I am now doing 1-1s weekly which is such a treat. Niki’s taught me to really listen to my body, and how to improve lifetime injury patterns with her gentle and encouraging teaching, and still get strong. Also no-nonsense when needed! Those days when I say I can’t, but don’t really mean it, and she says ‘course you can’ in her inimitable down to earth, relaxed way, filled with kindness and yoga wisdom (and life advice when required!). Every lesson is different and I can see just how much work Niki has put into planning. I look forward to my weekly session with her.
